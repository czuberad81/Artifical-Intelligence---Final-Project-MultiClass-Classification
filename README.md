# Artifical-Intelligence---Final-Project-MultiClass-Classification

The following research is based on the implementation and use of multiclass classification using the Chess (King-Rook vs. King-Pawn) dataset. Using PyCaret, the project demonstrates how to create a multiclass model, and tune the developed models' hyper-parameters for plotting and making predictions. The project examines and compares the performance of decision tree classifiers, K neighbors classifiers, and logistic regressions. According to the comparisons, the K neighbors model has an accuracy score of 0.9421, the decision tree model has an accuracy score of 0.9409, and the logistic regression model has an accuracy score of 0.9606.
